# üîê Can You Login?

Welcome to the "[Can You Login?](https://didoes14.github.io/Can_you_login/index.html)" game! This static site game challenges players to crack a login password with hints provided through a messaging system. But there‚Äôs a twist: to make cheating difficult, the code is purposely obfuscated!


## üìñ Overview

The goal of this game is simple: figure out the correct login password. The player starts without knowing the password and must attempt guesses, receiving hints for incorrect guesses to gradually guide them toward the solution. 

(One relatively big hint: The idea came from a rather popular meme)

All game logic is implemented in JavaScript and is intentionally obfuscated to prevent easy code-based cheating. However, dedicated players may still find ways to inspect the code, but the obfuscation adds a layer of challenge and immersion.


## üéÆ How to Play

1) Enter a Password Guess: Type in a password you think could be the answer. 
2) Receive Hints: If the password is incorrect, a messaging system will provide hints, leading you closer to the correct answer.
3) Maybe explore the site a little (there are easter eggs ü•ö).
3) Crack the Password: Keep following the hints until you find the correct password and successfully log in!


## Features

- Hint-Based System: Every incorrect password triggers a hint to help players gradually approach the correct answer.
- Obfuscated JavaScript Logic: The JavaScript file has been intentionally scrambled to prevent players from easily viewing the correct password in the code.
- Static Site: The game is fully functional as a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site, making it lightweight and easy to deploy (as it is deployed in [github pages](https://pages.github.com)).

## üîç Developer Notes

- Obfuscation Purpose: While it‚Äôs still possible for determined players to find the answer by inspecting the code, the obfuscation serves to deter casual attempts and make the game more engaging.
- Customization: If you wish to adjust the hints or modify the game logic, it‚Äôs recommended to use the un-obfuscated version inside [Original Source.rar](https://github.com/DidoeS14/Can_you_login/blob/main/Original%20Source.rar) for easier readability and editing.

## ü§î FAQ

#### Can I inspect the JavaScript code to find the correct password?

The JavaScript file is obfuscated to make this challenging, but not impossible. The best experience comes from playing the game as intended!

#### Is it possible to change the hints or password?

Yes, if you have access to the un-obfuscated code, you can modify the hints or change the password.

#### Can this game be extended with more features?

Absolutely! Adding multiple levels, more complex hints, or even different types of challenges could make the game even more engaging.
